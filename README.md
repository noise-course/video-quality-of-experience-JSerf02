# Machine Learning for Computer Systems - Assignment 1
Name: Jacob Serfaty, CNET: jserfaty, UCID: 12302156

# How To Run
All code is stored in the Jupyter Notebook file `1-Video-Quality-Inference.ipynb`.

To run this notebook, you will need to download the datasets from Canvas and put
them into the `data` folder. There is already one dataset there that was taken
from the course GitHub. This dataset is the `netflix.pcap` dataset but already
preprocessed into a CSV with cleaner labels. I used this dataset for filtering
Netflix traffic instead of `netflix.pcap` as it was easier to work with and more
convenient to load.

# AI Usage
Per the course policy, we are allowed to use AI/LLMs to automate anything we are 
confident we can implement ourselves. In accordance with this policy, I acknoledge
that I used Gemini 2.5 Pro to write initial drafts of much of the code for this 
assignment. I also had some version of the VSCode copilot autocomplete enabled
for part of this project (before I reached my quota; this wasn't particularly 
helpful).

I can locate and send the Gemini chats if requested and I am prepared to explain 
any code and the thought process behind the methods I used.
